All BDC sounds, ripped directly from "BDC Data A|B"
I wrote a basic unpacker for the compressed format used
by the game -> [/tools/pcm4.c]
This outputs raw PCM, mono, unsigned 8-bit, sample rate 11 kHz.
Then passed to SoX to add WAVE headers.

There are 100 sound IDs (#0 thru #99), but a few
are undefined.
Undefined IDs:
      #31, #33, #36, #39
      #40, #41, #45, #46
      #88, #89, #95, #98

Note that the game designates sounds #95 thru #99
as "looping", ie continuous.  Only #96, #97 and
#99 are defined (B212LP, X212LP and YNRLP)

All others are one-shot.

Names ending in "A" are stored in "BDC Data A",
instead of the default "BDC Data B". eg (KEYSA)
Related sounds are numbered eg. (ORB1, ORB2)
Names ending in "X" are enemy death cries (RATX)

Enjoy!
